In this schematic, we use the adafruit flora as our main microcontrontoller of choice.
We use 4 data pads, along with the VCC pad to take inputs of our "clicks". To register these inputs, we use piezoelectric discs.
We have soldered a 1 megaohm resistor across the piezo wire
We have soldered an OLED display to Ground, SDA, SCL and 3.3 V pads
